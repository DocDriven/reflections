When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When collaborating with other people on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-
to-date with your remote repository?

    Maybe I am not interested in all changes made by other people because I consider them as not
    necessarily helpful.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?

    Forks only exist in GitHub. It basically clones an existing directory to your personal
    GitHub repository, while keeping a reference to the original. You use it to modify a project
    to your personal liking and uses while keeping the original untouched. You can however create
    a pull request for the original, so that the author can accept your proposed changes.

    Clones create a copy of an existing repository, while automatically creating a reference to
    where it was cloned from as remote origin/master. You use it to create a working copy on your
    local machine.

    Branches are tags in a repository, which refer to specific commits. Branches are used to test
    new features while keeping a master branch that is always working intact. If the feature works,
    you can merge the branch into another branch.
