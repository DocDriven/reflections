When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When collaborating with other people on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-
to-date with your remote repository?

    Maybe I am not interested in all changes made by other people because I consider them as not
    necessarily helpful.
