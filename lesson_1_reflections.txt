How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I don't have to check the whole file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I could track down bugs faster and easier.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: I can make sure that I never commit buggy code.
    Con: I have to remember to commit my changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is often used for bigger projects, where the code written in different
    files has to work together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With the bash.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know that I have a backup if something goes wrong.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For all my projects.
